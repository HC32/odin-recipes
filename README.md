Building a basic recipe website.

This is the first project I am doing as part of The Odin Project's course.
The goal is to create the site without the course's guidance and demonstrate the
ability to set up the basic structure of a site with HTML: format with headings 
and paragraphs, add images, create links, and use lists.
